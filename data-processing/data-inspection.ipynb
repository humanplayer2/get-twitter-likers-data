We suggest to compare with the maximal number (instead of, e.g., the latest number) of likes to account for retracted and deleted likes/retweets as well as deleted tweets.\n",

    "Example: We compare to the maximum number of likes instead of the latest number (e.g. last logged for final harvest) to account for the following case: A tweet may have gotten 100 likes early on that the script misses, and then slowly gets 100 more likes that the script all collects as intended, while the first 100 unlike or have their accounts deleted. Going by the latest like count, this would not inform us that we missed out, but tell us that we got 100 out of 100 likers.\n",
